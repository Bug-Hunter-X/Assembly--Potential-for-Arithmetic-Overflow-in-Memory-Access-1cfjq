mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`.  The problem arises if `ecx` is a very large number, potentially causing an arithmetic overflow or exceeding the addressable memory space. This leads to accessing memory outside the program's allocated space, resulting in a segmentation fault or unpredictable behavior. The code lacks proper bounds checking on `ecx` to prevent this out-of-bounds access.
